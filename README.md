# Employee Database Management

## Overview

This Java application demonstrates basic database operations on an employee database. It uses JDBC to connect to a Microsoft Access database and allows users to view, insert, and update employee records. This example serves as a basic introduction to database interaction in Java.

## Features

- **Database Connection**: Connects to a Microsoft Access database using JDBC.
- **View Employee Records**: Retrieves and displays all employee records from the database.
- **Insert Employee Records**: Allows the insertion of new employee records into the database.
- **Update Employee Records**: Supports updating existing employee records.

- ## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Microsoft Access or a compatible database manager installed.
- `Employee.accdb` database file setup with an `EMPLOYEE` table.

## Setup

1. Ensure the `Employee.accdb` database file is located in your project directory or update the database URL in the code to reflect the correct path.
2. The `EMPLOYEE` table should contain at least the following columns: `ID` (AutoIncrement), `Name` (Text), and `Salary` (Number).
